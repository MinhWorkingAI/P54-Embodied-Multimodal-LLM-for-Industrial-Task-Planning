# URDF Asset Documentation

**Project:** P54 — Embodied Multimodal LLM for Industrial Task Planning  
**Package:** `simulation_backend/assets/urdf/`  
**Last updated:** May 2026

## Overview

This document covers all URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files used in the simulation backend of this project. It details the origin, authorship, licence status, physical properties, and intended usage of each file.

URDF is an XML-based format used by ROS and PyBullet to describe the physical, visual, and collision properties of robots and objects in a simulation environment. Each URDF defines one or more **links** (rigid bodies) and optionally **joints** (connections between links).

## Authorship and Licence

### Custom-authored URDFs (this project)

The following URDF files were authored specifically for this project by the P54 development team and are original works:

| File | Author | Date |
|---|---|---|
| `block.urdf` | P54 Team | May 2026 |
| `tray.urdf` | P54 Team | May 2026 |
| `table.urdf` | P54 Team | May 2026 |
| `workstation.urdf` | P54 Team | May 2026 |

These files are original works created for the COS40005 Computing Technology Project A at Swinburne University of Technology in collaboration with ARENA2036. They are not derived from, copied from, or adapted from any third-party URDF repositories.

**Licence:** These files are released under the same licence as the broader P54 project repository. If no explicit project licence is specified, all rights are reserved by the authors and Swinburne University of Technology.

### Third-party URDFs (robot models — not in this folder)

Robot URDFs used in `simulation_backend/robots/` are sourced from third parties and carry their own licences. These are documented here for completeness.

## URDF Format Reference

All files in this package conform to the URDF specification maintained by the ROS project. The authoritative specification is available at:

## Modifying or Adding URDFs

To add a new object to the simulation:

1. Create a new `.urdf` file in `simulation_backend/assets/urdf/` using primitive geometry (`<box>`, `<sphere>`, `<cylinder>`)
2. Add a new entry to the `objects` list in `simulation_backend/scene_config.yaml`
3. No code changes are required — `object_loader.py` reads the config and loads all entries automatically

To modify an existing object's dimensions, edit the `size` attribute in both the `<visual>` and `<collision>` elements. Always keep both consistent — mismatched visual and collision geometry causes objects to appear in different positions than where physics interactions occur.

To change an object's default colour, edit the `<color rgba>` in the URDF or update the `color` field in `scene_config.yaml`. The `scene_config.yaml` value takes precedence at runtime since `object_loader.py` calls `changeVisualShape()` after loading.

## Coordinate System

All URDF files use the standard ROS/PyBullet right-handed coordinate system:

- **X axis** — forward (away from robot base by convention)
- **Y axis** — left
- **Z axis** — up

Distances are in **metres**. Angles are in **radians**. Mass is in **kilograms**.
